Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.75,0:05:18.50,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Where?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.79,0:05:21.25,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Not telling.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.67,0:05:23.01,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Why not?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.63,0:05:25.97,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Because I know you'd show up if I did.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.15,0:05:44.53,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2\i1}Keeping my distance from others\Nmakes me cat-like, it seems.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.07,0:05:50.05,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2\i1}I guess there's a part of me\Nthat doesn't want to open up to people.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.49,0:05:55.00,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}But Adachi's basically the same.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:06.13,0:06:07.55,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,What is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.05,0:06:10.05,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,I prefer this way, I think.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.05,0:06:11.26,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, really?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:11.68,0:06:15.60,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, this way I can catch your scent.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.98,0:06:18.44,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,What? Wait, do I have B.O.?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.44,0:06:20.61,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,That's not what I meant.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.23,0:06:23.51,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Fine, I won't.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:24.23,0:06:26.90,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Shimamura, you're not classy at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.61,0:06:31.62,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Classy. Hmm... classy, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.20,0:06:34.83,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I don't think anyone's told me that before.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.08,0:06:37.21,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Say, Adachi.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.21,0:06:41.42,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Wanna go to class together after lunch?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.42,0:06:46.30,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Where'd that idea come from?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.30,0:06:48.13,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Well, there's a minimum required attendance.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.72,0:06:52.64,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2}Basically, it'd be more fun\Nif we became second-years together.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.01,0:06:55.35,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Together...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.72,0:06:58.14,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,I guess every now and then's fine.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.14,0:06:59.89,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,All right!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.89,0:07:00.60,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Then hey,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.02,0:07:02.86,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,let's go somewhere after class.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.02,0:07:06.78,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Do you have plans already?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.78,0:07:07.86,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Not today.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.32,0:07:15.61,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Maybe I'll actually get a bite today.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.37,0:07:22.25,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}High school is its very own, unique society,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.25,0:07:25.42,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}so bringing those elements outside of it can be weird.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.38,0:07:31.93,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2\i1}So it makes sense why some people\Nwould prefer to simply live here.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.01,0:07:36.93,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}But regardless, I want to land a better future.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.93,0:07:40.77,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\i1}And if I don't cast my line, nothing's gonna start.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.19,0:07:43.69,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,How were your classes?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.69,0:07:48.11,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2}History was good, but I don't know\Nhow to do math anymore.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.61,0:07:52.91,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2}I don't know either and I've been\Nto class way more than you,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.91,0:07:54.78,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,so where does that put me?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.32,0:07:58.16,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,You caught a lot of eyes today, Shimamura.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:58.16,0:08:00.29,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Nah, I'm pretty sure that was you.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.71,0:08:02.79,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,No, you were the one getting attention.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.67,0:08:05.75,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,It's probably because you're so pretty.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.13,0:08:06.96,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:07.71,0:08:08.71,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,What's wrong?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.30,0:08:12.93,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,It's just that I've never been called pretty before, so...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.30,0:08:17.26,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Really? Not even by, say... your boyfriend?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.72,0:08:19.68,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,I've never had one.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.01,0:08:24.98,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,I guess everybody's blind, then.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.98,0:08:25.85,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.59,0:08:27.82,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Wait, where's your bike?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.57,0:08:30.02,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,It's out for repairs.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.02,0:08:33.32,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Huh... So you actually walked to school. Well done.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.86,0:08:36.49,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,I thought maybe you'd be here.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.83,0:08:41.91,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,R-Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.24,0:08:50.38,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Mm, sugar!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.92,0:08:53.66,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Are you going to classes tomorrow, Shimamura?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.26,0:08:58.26,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,{\q2}Well, I want to try to stick with it—\Nfor at least three days or so.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.83,0:09:00.03,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.41,0:09:03.02,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,What say you, Adachi?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.02,0:09:05.01,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Shall we soldier on together?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.14,0:09:09.27,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Sure, a few more days couldn't hurt.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.69,0:09:13.11,Adashima - Default,,0,0,0,,Want a bite?

## Project Structure

Script merging (dialogue+typesetting, bringing in OP and ED) and release muxing are handled through [SubKt](https://github.com/Myaamori/subkt/), which is a build system for doing the things I just mentioned, among others. The various SubKt-related files are not currently included in this repo.
